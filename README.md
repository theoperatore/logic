# Logic

[demo](https://logic.alorg.net).

It's all hard-coded values, but allows the user to select different meanings and symbols / rules and apply those rules to an inputted number set. This app outputs the correct answer.

This tool is helpful to DMs who want to give the players:

- An input number set for 4 symbols: Blade, Crown, Sun, Tree
- A banner color
- An animal
- An animal color
- An ornament

And let players derrive the resulting output numbers.

Shoutout to my buddy who was the original inspiration for this tool. I just codified and pushed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
